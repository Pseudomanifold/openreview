# Creating your Venue Instance: Submitting a Venue Request Form

Submitting a venue request form is the first step towards hosting a venue on OpenReview. Go to [https://openreview.net/group?id=OpenReview.net/Support](https://openreview.net/group?id=OpenReview.net/Support) and click 'OpenReview Support Request Form'. This is where you will select many of the settings for your venue, such as whether or not submissions and reviews should be public or private, anonymous or not.

After you submit the form, our team will review it and deploy it, making your venue live. You can then edit some of your selected settings from the venue request form. Note that if you do not enter a submission start date, submissions will open immediately upon venue deployment.
