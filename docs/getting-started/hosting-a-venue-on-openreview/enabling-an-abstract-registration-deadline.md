# Enabling an Abstract Registration Deadline

You can set an abstract deadline either when submitting your [Support Request Form](creating-your-venue-instance-submitting-a-venue-request-form.md), or after your venue is deployed using the ‘Revision’ button on your [venue request form](navigating-your-venue-pages.md#venue-request-form). Until the Abstract Registration deadline, authors will have the option to modify their submissions using the ‘edit’ button in the top right corner of their papers’ forum page.

If you want to allow authors to edit their submissions after the Abstract Registration deadline but before the Submission deadline, you can run the ‘Post Submission Stage’ from your venue request form after the submission deadline. The ‘Post Submission Stage’ creates paper groups, which are required for allowing authors access to their submissions after a deadline. It also creates blinded copies to anonymize submissions, if applicable. After the submission deadline, authors will lose the ability to revise their submissions, unless you run the ‘Submission Revision Stage’. If you change the Submission deadline, you will need to re-run the ‘Post Submission Stage’ in order to update the deadline for authors to revise their papers.
