# Live Chat on the Forum Page

There is a new OpenReview chat feature available to support synchronous dialog among reviewers and ACs.&#x20;

Program Chairs can enable this feature using the [Comment Stage](../reference/stages/comment-stage.md) and selecting the option "Enable Chat Between Committee Members". Members of the committee must be selected as participants.&#x20;

With encouragement and funding from the Sloan Foundation the OpenReview team has implemented and launched a synchronous chat text messaging system, somewhat like Slack.\


**Chat features**

* Type a simple message, and it appears immediately to other reviewers who have the same forum open in their browser, enabling interactive discussion.
* Messages are visible all program chairs, area chairs, and reviewers for the paper.  The ability to send private message to a subset is currently being designed for future deployment.
* Chat messages will be shown in the “Committee Chat” tab, but not the “Discussion” tab.
* Use Markdown formatting and LaTex equations.
* Optionally reply to specific earlier chat message.
* Copy the URL pointing to a specific chat message.
* Browser and email notifications are supported. User should enable browser notifications from their browser. Email notifications will be sent in bulk either every 5 messages or every 4 hours.&#x20;

**Motivation:**

\
In decades past, many peer reviewed yearly conferences in computer science (such as NeurIPS and CVPR) held an in-person meeting among the 20-30 “area chairs” of the conference to discuss and debate each paper.  These meetings enabled extensive synchronous communication and serendipitous discussion during the final decision-making phase of the peer review process.&#x20;

\
Unfortunately, these practices of in-person area-chair meetings are increasingly rare due to growing conference size, travel expenses, and (more recently) risks from the pandemic.  Given the current universal use of web tools for reviewing, one might hope that the scientific communities would take advantage of internet technology to greatly increase interactivity in peer review, unfortunately, the style of reviewing workflow remains largely unchanged. &#x20;

One interesting exception is the introduction of “rebuttal statements” (an opportunity for authors to write a response to first drafts of the reviews), and asynchronous messages among the reviewing team. &#x20;

\
However, due to the lack of synchronous communication so valuable in the once-common in-person meetings, discussion of these rebuttals (and scientific debate among the decision-making team) is hampered––often lackluster or incomplete. &#x20;

Synchronous communication creates both (1) beneficial social pressure for engagement and (2) the opportunity for interactive clarification without the extensive “context switching” inherent in asynchronously juggling many tasks.  (For example, highly experienced computer science reviewer and OpenReview user has told us “The burden of context switching after 24 hours away from a conversation can sometimes be the bottleneck in writing a response; re-remembering the details of a paper often takes even more time than writing a reply to a co-reviewer. Synchronous communication could dramatically reduce the burden––and increase quality––of reviewing by removing this context-switching bottleneck.”)

\
While your reviewers may naturally find each other online at the same time, and benefit from the chat feature, scheduled chat discussion sessions may be even more helpful.\
Scheduling synchronous sessions will be one key aspect of recapturing the benefits of in-person synchronous discussion.  The details and cultural considerations of this scheduling will be driven by the program chairs. The in-person meetings were a burden, but also provided a scientific/social occasion that was enjoyed and cherished; we anticipate that with some sensitive design, program chairs can provide a similar occasion.  The burden can be reduced by culling from the process submissions that are clear rejections.&#x20;

\
Why text messaging rather than audio/video?  Although speaking is easy, typing has multiple advantages:  Typed messages can be more easily archived, read later, skimmed quickly, analyzed, and studied.  Many people are used to interactive synchronous text chat tools, such as Slack, and find them very productive.  Furthermore, text has high accessibility, and is recommended by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0). By text entry, users can naturally make some statements publicly (like a comment during a presentation session, or comment to the group at a poster), and mark others as private (like a whispered comment at a poster session, or private hallway conversation); scientists are already used to this ability in typed chat systems such as Slack or Zoom.  Typed chat messages support not only fully-synchronous interaction, but also interactive semi-synchronous interaction (e.g. with two minute interruption or delay), which fits modern work-styles. If some users are slow typists, they can use voice recognition on their local machine to “type” messages at speaking speed.
