# How do I find a venue id?

There are a few different ways to find your venue id.

1. If you are a Program Chair, go to your [venue request form](../hosting-a-venue-on-openreview/navigating-your-venue-pages.md) and copy the information in the field Venue ID
2. Use the URL of the submission page. The venue id is the portion of the url after `group?id:`For example for ICLR 2024 the submission homepage is : [https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2024/Conference#tab-accept-oral](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2024/Conference#tab-accept-oral), and the venue id is `ICLR.cc/2024/Conference`

If you are having trouble with your venue id, ensure that there is no trailing backslash (e.g. `ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/` is incorrect)
