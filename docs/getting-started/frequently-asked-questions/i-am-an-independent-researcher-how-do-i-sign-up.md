# I am an Independent Researcher, how do I sign up?

We've received many emails from concerned researchers who want to sign up quickly but aren't affiliated with an academic institution.&#x20;

The institutional domain does not have to be an academic institution, like a university or research institution. It can be any company that you are working in right now.&#x20;

When filling out the profile details for registration, there is a section that will ask for your Education and Career History and it will require a current position. For the role you can type “Independent Researcher” and set that as your current position.

If you do not have a company domain, you can use a personal email.
