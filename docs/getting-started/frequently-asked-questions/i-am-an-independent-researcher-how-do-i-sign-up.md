# I am an Independent Researcher, how do I sign up?

We've received many emails from concerned researchers who want to sign up quickly but aren't affiliated with an academic institution.&#x20;

If you are not affiliated with an academic institution, but are employed at a company, you can use that domain and position information to sign up. You may need to request OpenReview add your company as an institutional domain.

If you do not have a company domain, you can use a personal email. All personal emails will be moderated - see [Expediting Profile Activation](../creating-an-openreview-profile/expediting-profile-activation.md) for additional tips on how to make sure your profile is activated as quickly as possible. &#x20;

When filling out the profile details for registration, there is a section that will ask for your Education and Career History, which will require a current position. For the role you can type “Independent Researcher” and set that as your current position and type in a domain. &#x20;

Please do not use an old role or affiliation as your current position, as that may delay moderation.
