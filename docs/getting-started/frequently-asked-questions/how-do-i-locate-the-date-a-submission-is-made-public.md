# How do I locate the date a submission is made public?

Publication date(pdate) means when the venue marked the paper as accepted.&#x20;

Modification date(mdate) means when the last time the paper was modified.

The odate means when the submission becomes public. To check the odate of a submission, see the note object [https://api2.openreview.net/notes?id=](https://api2.openreview.net/notes?id=RAA0vCLMhp)&#x20;

To find the id you can check the url of the submission, for example [https://openreview.net/forum?id=KS8mIvetg2](https://openreview.net/forum?id=KS8mIvetg2) . Use `id=KS8mIvetg2` , the note object url will be [https://api2.openreview.net/notes?id=KS8mIvetg2](https://api2.openreview.net/notes?id=KS8mIvetg2).
