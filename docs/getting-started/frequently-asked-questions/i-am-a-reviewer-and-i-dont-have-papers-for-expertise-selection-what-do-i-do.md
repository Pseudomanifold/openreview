# I am a reviewer and I don't have papers for Expertise Selection, what do I do?

The OpenReview system uses the reviewer's publications from Expertise Selection in order to match reviewers and papers via affinity scores.  Reviewers who do not have existing publications should leave the Expertise Selection form blank, and the reviewer will not be assigned an affinity score for a paper.

Decisions on how to assign reviewers without affinity scores is at the discretion of the venue organizers. Please contact the venue organizers if you have further questions about how review assignment will work for a specific venue.

Note: There is no 'Submit' button for Expertise Selection, and the task will show in your pending queue (where you can make changes) until the task expires at which time the task will automatically leave the queue.&#x20;
