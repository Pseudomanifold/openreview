# How do I add/change an author of my submission after the deadline?

Each venue decides its own policy for how to handle requests to change the authorship list, order, or author details after the deadline. This is sometimes listed on the venue website or FAQ. If you need to request a change to your submission after the submission deadline has passed, please contact the venue organizers.
