# Reviewers for my venue cannot see their assigned submissions, what should I do?

In order for a reviewer to see their assigned submissions, they need to be logged into an OpenReview account that has read permissions for the submission.

If a specific reviewer cannot access their assigned submission, they may need to check that the email they received the invitation to is added and confirmed to their account- The email should be listed in their profile with (Confirmed) next to it. If this is not the case, they should follow the steps to [add an email ](../creating-an-openreview-profile/add-or-remove-an-email-address-from-your-profile.md)to their account.

If all reviewers cannot access the forum page of their assigned submission, check that they are readers of the submission they are assigned to. On the [Venue Request Form](../hosting-a-venue-on-openreview/navigating-your-venue-pages.md), make sure that the Submission Readers field includes reviewers.  If reviewers are not listed as a reader, update the [Post Submission](../../reference/stages/post-submission-stage.md) stage to add them as readers for their submissions.
