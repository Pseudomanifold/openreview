# Will Reviewers be notified of their Assignments?

Reviewers will see their assigned papers in their Reviewer console and in their Task list. Depending on what method you used to assign Reviewers to papers, they may have already been notified of their assignments:&#x20;

#### Automatic Assignment Deployed through the Edge Browser

If you deployed an assignment configuration from the edge browser, Reviewers would not have received a notification of their assignments.&#x20;

#### Manual Assignment through the Edge Browser&#x20;

If you use the "Assign" button to add a Reviewer to a paper, the Reviewer will receive a notification of their new assignment.&#x20;
