# Add or remove a name from your profile

1. Go to your profile page at https://openreview.net/profile
2. Click 'Edit Profile'.
3. Locate the 'Names' section and click the blue plus sign underneath your name.&#x20;
4. Enter your name and then click ‘Save Profile Changes’ at the bottom of the page.

If you would like to make that name preferred, you can do so by clicking ‘Edit profile’ once more and selecting ‘Make Preferred’ next to your desired name. The option to make a name preferred will not appear until you have saved the new name to your profile.&#x20;

If you want a name removed from your profile, you will need to contact OpenReview support at info@openreview.net.
