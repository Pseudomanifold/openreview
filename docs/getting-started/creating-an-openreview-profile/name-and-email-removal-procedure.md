# Name and Email Removal Procedure

#### Name Changes

OpenReview offers users the possibility of changing their name on their profiles and publications.&#x20;

1. User's profile: users can keep multiple names in their profiles and select one as preferred, which will be used for author submission and identity display. Users can decide if they want to delete a name from their profile.&#x20;
2. User's publications: publications can be updated with the user's preferred name. OpenReview doesn't take any action on PDF files so the change name in the file should also be authorized by the organizers of the venue.

If you would like a name removed from your profile, please contact us at info@openreview.net or through the feedback form and we will work quickly to carry out these actions.

#### Email Address Removal&#x20;

OpenReview uses email addresses associated with current or former affiliations for profile deduplication, conflict detection, and paper coreference. For this reason, OpenReview prefers to keep all current and former institutional email addresses on each user's profile. OpenReview will only send messages to the address marked as “Preferred”. OpenReview only displays obfuscated emails (\*\*\*\*@umass.edu) and never releases full email addresses to the public. If there is an email address you want removed from your profile, please reach out to info@openreview.net.&#x20;
