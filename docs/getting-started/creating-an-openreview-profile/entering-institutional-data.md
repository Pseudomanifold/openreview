# Entering Institutional Data

To add institutional data to your OpenReview profile, go to your profile page at [https://openreview.net/profile](https://openreview.net/profile) and click 'Edit profile'. You must enter at least one position under 'Education & Career History' for your profile to be saved.&#x20;

Each position requires at least the following information: Position, Start date, Institution Info (domain, name, and country).

For the Position field, you can choose a position from the dropdown or, if none of the existing positions are a good fit, **you may type in a custom role**. Make sure to click in the custom role as it appear in the dropdown in order to select it for that field, otherwise no value will be entered.

Similarly for the institution name and domain, choose from the dropdown or type the name and domain yourself. If you are not sure what domain to type in for your institution, use the email domain used in institutional emails.

{% hint style="info" %}
When you type in custom information that data will appear in the dropdown. Click to select it or the textbox will return to blank when you click away.
{% endhint %}

A start date is required for all affiliations. If your affiliation is current, leave the end date blank, otherwise include the end date for past affiliations

Below are some examples of complete Education and Career History sections:
