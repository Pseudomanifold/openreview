# Merging Profiles

If you have multiple profiles and would like to merge them, you can follow these steps:

1. Log in using the email address associated with any one of your profiles. Preferably, the one you want to merge the other profiles into.
2. Add the email address that is already confirmed in your other profile to the profile you're currently logged into. (You can skip to step 3 if you have already added this email address.)
3. Click on "Confirm."
4. You will receive an email to confirm the profile merge.

If you do not recognize a profile flagged as duplicate being yours, or do not have access to the email address of the other profile, please reach out to us at info@openreview.net.
