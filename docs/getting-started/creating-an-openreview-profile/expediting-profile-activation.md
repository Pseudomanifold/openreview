# Expediting Profile Activation

If you received an email with the subject ‘OpenReview profile activation pending’, your profile is in moderation. The fastest way to activate an OpenReview Account is to ensure that you have an email associated with your school or company added and confirmed to your profile.

Note: Do not try to register a second time with your institutional email, which often causes users to run into issues with duplicate information in their multiple profiles. Rather, add your institutional email to your pending account to expedite profile activation
{% endhint %}

## How to add an institutional email to a pending account

Please note that all three steps must be completed for the institutional email to be confirmed.

1. Open the activation link sent to your email (subject: OpenReview signup confirmation). If your link is expired resend it following the directions [here](resending-an-activation-link.md).&#x20;
2. Add an email associated with your institution (university, lab, or company) to your profile. Make sure to press Confirm to save the email to your account.

3. DO NOT close your current window/tab. The verification number sent to your inbox needs to be input in the same window/tab.
4. Confirm that email by pasting the verification code and clicking on Verify.&#x20;

## Common questions about pending profiles

### I want to publish / receive emails under a personal email, what do I do?

After creating an account, you can set your preferred email to your personal email account, and this will be the email used for submissions and notifications.

### I have an institutional email in my profile, why is my profile still pending?

Please check that your email has (confirmed) next to it in your profile page. If your email is confirmed, it is likely that your institution has not yet been added to our list. Submit a request for us to add your institution to our list through our Feedback form.

### I don’t have an institutional email, what else can I do to speed up the process?

If you don’t have any institutional emails, please ensure your other profile information is complete. Ensuring your homepage displays your email and career details, along with a fully completed profile, will facilitate the activation process.
