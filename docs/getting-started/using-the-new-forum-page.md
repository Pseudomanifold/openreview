# Using the New Forum Page

OpenReview is releasing a major update of the forum page for venues using the new API (v2). While the interface will look familiar, it should be faster, more flexible, and offer new ways to quickly find the content you are looking for.

#### Accessing the Page

The new forum UI can be accessed by changing the URL of any existing TMLR forum page from   `/forum` to `/forum-new`. For example: [https://openreview.net/forum-new?id=8HuyXvbvqX](https://openreview.net/forum-new?id=8HuyXvbvqX)

#### Sorting and Filtering Replies

The new forum page provides advanced controls for sorting and filtering replies such as comments, reviews, private responses, and PC decisions. The new controls look something like this:

1. Invitation Filter: show only replies of a certain type. Can select multiple invitations (types) to show replies matching any of those invitations.
2. Author Filter: show only replies signed by the selected user or group. Can select multiple authors to show all replies that include any one of the selections as a signature.
3. Keyword Filter: show all replies that match the phrase. Matches can come from the content of the reply, the title, or the invitation.
4. Sort Control: change the order of replies shown to either most recent first or oldest first
5. Layout Control: change the level of nesting of the replies. The three options are&#x20;
   * Linear: all replies are shown at the same level of nesting
   * Threaded: one level of nesting is shown
   * Nested: two levels of nesting are shown
6. Collapse Control: change how much of all the replies is shown. By default the entire contents of the reply is visible, this corresponds to the three lines. Selecting the middle button (two lines) will only show the first 5-10 lines of content, and selecting the left button (one line) will condense the replies down to a single line displaying just basic information.
7. Link Button: copy a URL to your clipboard that includes all the currently selected filter and sort options. This is useful for sharing specific views of a forum page with other people or bookmarking for later.
8. Readers Filter: show all the replies that have the selected users or groups listed as a reader. Clicking a button twice will turn the button red â€“ this means that only the replies that DO NOT include that group as a reader will be shown.
9. Preset Views: venues can configure sets of filters and layout options that are displayed as tabs above the filter form. Clicking on a given tab will switch the current filters over to those settings.

#### Providing Feedback
