# How to Recruit and Remind Recruited Reviewers

On the request form for your venue, click on the ‘Recruitment’ button to recruit reviewers (and ACs if applicable). You can use the 'Remind Recruitment' button to send a reminder to Reviewers who have not yet accepted or declined your invitation.

* All invited reviewers will appear in the group venue\_id/Reviewers/Invited&#x20;
* Reviewers who accept the invitation will be added to the group venue\_id/Reviewers
* Reviewers who decline the invitation will be added to the group venue\_id/Reviewers\_Declined.&#x20;

You can find links to these groups on your PC console.&#x20;
