# How to Preview Modifications Made to the Forms

You can use the Invitation editor to preview the changes made to your forms.&#x20;

1. View your invitation in the invitation editor. There are two ways to open the invitation editor:&#x20;
   1. Go to your venue homepage, click 'Edit Group', and click on your invitation of choice under 'Related Invitations'.
   2. Go to https://openreview.net/invitation/edit?id=Your/Venue/Id/-/Invitation
2. Edit the Reply Parameters field. Enter and remove fields in valid JSON as you choose. Do not hit 'Save Invitation'.&#x20;
3. View your changes in the 'Preview' tab.&#x20;
4. Once you are happy with your JSON, use the [venue request form](../../getting-started/hosting-a-venue-on-openreview/navigating-your-venue-pages.md#venue-request-form) to make your desired changes to the form. You can copy the JSON  of new fields into the 'Additional \_\_\_ __ Options' field, and remove fields using the 'Remove __ \_\_\_ Options' field.&#x20;
