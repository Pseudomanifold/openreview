# How to test your venue workflow

Test venues and profiles are not allowed on the live OpenReview site. You can test your venue workflow using the dev site: [dev.openreview.net](https://dev.openreview.net/). In order to do so, create a profile and [submit a venue request form](../../getting-started/hosting-a-venue-on-openreview/creating-your-venue-instance-submitting-a-venue-request-form.md), just as you would on the live site.
