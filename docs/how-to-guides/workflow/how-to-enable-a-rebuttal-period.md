# How to Enable a Rebuttal Period

OpenReview does not support a rebuttal stage in the sense that Authors can only respond once to their reviews. Venues typically mimic the rebuttal functionality using the comment stage, which allows authors to address the Reviews posted to their submissions but does not limit them to a single response.&#x20;

1. [Release reviews to authors](how-to-release-reviews.md), if they are not released already.&#x20;
2. Run the '[Comment Stage](../../reference/stages/comment-stage.md)' with your desired participants, start, and end dates.&#x20;
