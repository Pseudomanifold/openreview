# How to Make Submissions Available Before the Submission Deadline

On the request form for your venue, click on the ‘Post Submission’ button to make submissions available according to the settings selected in the fields ‘Author and Reviewer Anonymity’ and ‘Submission Readers’ of the venue request. This means that:

* If submissions are double blind, blind copies of submissions will be created (make sure to select Force=True). You can also choose which fields are kept hidden (author names are automatically hidden).
* If you select the option ‘Everyone (submissions are public)’ in ‘Submission Readers’, then all submissions will be public.
* If submissions should be private, then they can be released to the assigned program committee (only assigned reviewers, for example), to the entire program committee (all reviewers), or to PCs and authors only.
