# How to begin Review Stage while Submissions are Open

**This option is only available for Single Blind, public venues.**&#x20;

In order to begin reviewing while still accepting submissions, you will need to run the ‘Post Submission Stage’ in order to create paper groups. Then you can run the ‘Review’ stage. You will need to repeat these two steps continuously until the Submission deadline has passed to generate the paper groups and review invitations for new submissions.
