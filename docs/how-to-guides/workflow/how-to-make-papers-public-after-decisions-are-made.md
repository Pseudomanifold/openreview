# How to make papers public after decisions are made

Once decisions have been posted, you will see a ‘Post Decision Stage’ button on the [venue request form](../../getting-started/hosting-a-venue-on-openreview/navigating-your-venue-pages.md#venue-request-form). Click on this button to choose between releasing all papers or only accepted papers to the public.
