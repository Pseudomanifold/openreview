# How to edit the Review Revision

The Review Revision Stage is run when PCs want to add new fields to a review for reviewers to fill out usually after the rebuttal period. These new fields are often the final rating of the paper and the justification for changing the rating. This stage cannot be run from the venue request page and must be requested.

When Review Revisions are active, there will be a "Review Revision" button on the top right side of the posted Official Review. After submitting their revision, the reviewer may need to edit the revision. Clicking on the edit button for the review will not edit the revision fields.&#x20;

To edit the revision:

1. Click on the "Show Revisions" link, found below the title of the review note and next to "Readers:"
2. You will be redirected to a page listing the revisions of the review. Click on the edit button next to the review revision
