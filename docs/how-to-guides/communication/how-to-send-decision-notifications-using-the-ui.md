# How to Send Decision Notifications Using the UI

After the decision stage closes, you will see the [Post Decision Stage](../../reference/stages/post-decision-stage.md) option on your venue request form. You will be able to use this stage to send bulk decision notifications to authors.&#x20;

1. Select "Yes, send an email notification to the authors" for the "Send Decision Notifications" field.
2. Customize the Email Content Fields. There should be one per decision type for your venue. Any fields in curly braces will be populated with the information for each paper. You can customize anything in the message so long as you do not remove the curly braces.&#x20;
3. Click submit and notification emails will be sent to all authors. Note that if you run Post Decision multiple times, it will send the decision notifications each time that "Yes, send an email notification to the authors" is selected. If you need to make changes to Post Submission stage without sending out emails each time, make sure to select "No, I will send the emails to the authors".&#x20;
