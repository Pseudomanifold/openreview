When bidding opens, Reviewers will see a task labelled "Reviewers Bid" in either their Tasks page or the Reviewers Console for that particular venue.

The due date is shown in red next to the link to the task. To access the Bidding Console, click on Reviewers Bid, and the user will be redirected to the Bidding Console. Here Reviewers can read instructions on the bidding process, including the expected number of bids and tips on placing bids.

Reviewers can search for a particular paper or view papers by their bid scoring. As long as PCs computed conflicts, submissions that the reviewer has conflicts with won't appear as a submission to bid on.

Reviewers can bid on a scale of Very High interest to Very Low interest, and they can modify these scores until Bidding closes.
