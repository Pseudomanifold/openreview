# How to Do Automatic Assignments

Venues that selected 'Automatic' for 'Submission Reviewer Assignment' in the venue request form will have the option to use automatic assignment by doing the following:

1. Make sure your submission deadline has passed.
2. [Calculate affinity scores and conflicts using Paper Matching Setup](how-to-setup-paper-matching-by-calculating-affinity-scores-and-conflicts.md).
3. [Run a matching](how-to-run-a-paper-matching.md).
4. [Modify and finalize the proposed assignments](how-to-modify-the-proposed-assignments.md).
5. [Deploy the proposed assignments](how-to-deploy-the-proposed-assignments.md).

You will have to perform all these steps for Senior Area Chairs, then for Area Chairs and Reviewers. Depending on your venue, the names of these groups may vary.
