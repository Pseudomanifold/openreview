# How to do automatic assignments

Venues that selected a value for 'Paper Matching' in the venue request form will have the option to use automatic assignment by doing the following:&#x20;

1. Make sure your submission deadline has passed. [Unless your venue is single blind and public](../../workflow/how-to-begin-the-review-stage-while-submissions-are-open.md), assignments cannot be made until after the submission deadline.
2. Run the [Post Submission](https://docs.openreview.net/reference/stages/post-submission-stage) stage to reveal submissions to reviewers.
3. Run the [Review Stage](../../../reference/stages/review-stage.md).
4. [Calculate affinity scores and conflicts using Paper Matching Setup](how-to-setup-paper-matching-by-calculating-affinity-scores-and-conflicts.md).&#x20;
5. [Run a matching](how-to-run-a-paper-matching.md).&#x20;
6. [Modify and finalize the proposed assignments](how-to-modify-the-proposed-assignments.md).&#x20;
7. [Deploy the proposed assignments](how-to-deploy-the-proposed-assignments.md).&#x20;
