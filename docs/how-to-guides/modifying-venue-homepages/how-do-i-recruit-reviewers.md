# How do I recruit reviewers?

To recruit reviewers, there is a feature located on the [venue request form](../../getting-started/hosting-a-venue-on-openreview/navigating-your-venue-pages.md) called "Recruitment", clicking this button will allow you to send emails to potential reviewers. To find more information, please see our documentation on [Reviewer Recruitment and Reminders](../managing-groups/how-to-recruit-and-remind-recruited-reviewers.md).
