# Group

Groups are used to organize the venue structure and to give permissions to every actor in the system.

For example, the base group of a conference is going to have the venue id as its id. Other groups like the Reviewers group, the Authors group or Area Chairs group will have the venue id as its prefix in their id to indicate what venue they belong to. Users that are members of a group automatically get the group's permissions. Only groups can be members of other groups. For this reason, profile ids and emails are also groups that can be added as members to other groups.
