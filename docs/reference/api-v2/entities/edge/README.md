# Edge

Edges are used to connect two entities. They usually represent matching data, like affinity scores, conflicts, custom quotas, etc. The Edge entity contains two main properties: `head` and `tail` and optionally a `label` and `weight`. `Head` and `tail` properties point to other entities in the system like a note, a group or a profile.
