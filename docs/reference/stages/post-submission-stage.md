# Post Submission Stage

#### What it Does&#x20;

The Post Submission Stage creates Paper groups and sets the readers of submissions accordingly. It also creates the anonymized versions of submissions, if applicable.&#x20;

#### When to Use it

The Post Submission Stage should be used when paper groups and blind copies need to be created. In general, this should be done:&#x20;

* After the Abstract Registration deadline to allow authors to revise their submissions&#x20;
* After the Submission Deadline to hide fields from authors or update submission readers&#x20;
* After the submission deadline has passed a second time after having been extended
