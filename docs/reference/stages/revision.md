# Revision

Venue organizers can use the Revision button accessible in the [venue request form](../../getting-started/hosting-a-venue-on-openreview/creating-your-venue-instance-submitting-a-venue-request-form.md#submitting-a-venue-request-form) after the venue has been [deployed](../../getting-started/hosting-a-venue-on-openreview/creating-your-venue-instance-submitting-a-venue-request-form.md#deployment) to customize the submission form and different due dates.&#x20;

The Revision button on the venue request form allows you to modify selections made in the support request form. There are also new fields, 'Additional Submission', 'Hide Fields', 'Remove Submission Options', which allow PCs to [modify the submission form.](../../getting-started/hosting-a-venue-on-openreview/customizing-your-submission-form.md)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Ensure that any modifications to the submission form are completed prior to any submissions being uploaded. Failing to do so will affect authors as they will encounter difficulties when attempting to update their submissions later on in the process. Resolving these issues typically requires the involvement of OpenReview staff.
{% endhint %}

Use of the Revision button will overwrite any changes to the Submission invitation that were made through the invitation editor rather than through the venue request form.
